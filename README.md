# Rock Paper Scissors - Python text-based take on a classic!

Pick your weapon and play against the computer - you'll only get a virtual sting if you lose!

Prerequisites: all you need is Phthon 3 to play.

Clone the project, cd to your directory / download, and run the game.py file in a Python3 Terminal window for Mac/Linux, or the powershell for Windows

The rules are the same as the classic game:
1. Paper covers Rock
2. Scissors cuts Paper
3. Rock smashes Scissors

Choose your weapon wisely!

uilt with Python 3

Enjoy!
